# Wget Clone

A wget clone implementation in Go that replicates core functionalities of the original wget utility.

## Description
This project recreates the fundamental features of wget using Go. Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the Web, supporting HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols.

## Project Objective
This project aims to recreate functionalities of wget using Go. The main objectives include:

- Downloading a file from a given URL, e.g., `wget https://some_url.org/file.zip`
- Saving a downloaded file under a different name.
- Specifying a directory for saving downloaded files.
- Limiting download speed.
- Supporting background downloads.
- Downloading multiple files simultaneously from a list of URLs.
- Mirroring an entire website.

## Functionalities

- Downloading with different flags:
  - `-O` for saving under a different name.
  - `-P` for specifying a save directory.
  - `--rate-limit` for setting download speed.
  - `-B` for background download with logging.
  - `-i` for downloading multiple files from a text file.
  - `--mirror` for mirroring websites with various options.

## Introduction
Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the Web. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as retrieval through HTTP proxies.

## Viewing Mirrored Websites
After mirroring a website, you can use any static file server to view the content. For example:
- Use VS Code's Live Server extension
- Use Python's built-in server: `python -m http.server`
- Use Node.js's `live-server` package
